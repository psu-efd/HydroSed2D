HydroSed2D for Linux: HydrsoSed2D was originally hosted on sourceforge. But for convinience, it has been migrated to GitHub. 

1. Installation
   git clone to our own computer. Usually, I will put the installation into $Home/research/HydroSed2D_public
   Modify the Makefile also to reflect the relative path.

   cd ~/research/HydroSed2D_public
   make

2. Run
   cd cases
   mkdir case1
   ln -s ../../bin/HydroSed2D ./   %link the excutable here

   %put all your input files in this directory
   mkdir input

   %results will be put in this directory
   mkdir results

   %run the job
   ./HydroSed2D

   (see the example case for details)

3. Post processing
   All results can be shown in Tecplot. Since Paraview can directly load Tecplot data, the results
   should be able to be loaded into Paraview too (haven't tested yet).

4. Notes
   * HydroSed2D is not actively developed any more. There are many alternatives such as SRH-2D and HEC-RAS 2D. 
   * It is archived here in case it is useful to others.
